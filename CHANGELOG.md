# Changelog

## 1.0.2

### Fixed
- **WebSocket not connecting during discharge**: regression from 1.0.1 adapter extraction — the brand-agnostic listeners don't trigger WS lifecycle. The discharge callback is now wrapped to call `_maybe_start_realtime_ws` after each check.

## 1.0.1

### Added
- **WebSocket real-time data**: optional ~5-second power data from the FoxESS Cloud WebSocket during smart sessions, reducing grid import risk from load spikes between 5-minute REST polls. Requires web portal credentials (optional config flow step). Connects automatically during paced discharge; `ws_all_sessions` toggle extends to all sessions.
- **Data source indicator on Lovelace cards**: badge shows "WS", "API", or "Modbus" when multiple data sources are configured, so users know which source is driving displayed values. Immediately switches on WS connect/disconnect.
- **Deferred self-use for smart discharge**: stays in self-use mode until a deadline calculation requires forced discharge, preventing grid import from low paced power
- **Peak consumption tracking**: exponential decay (~4.3 min half-life at 1-min ticks), floors discharge power at peak × 1.5 to absorb inter-poll load spikes
- **End-of-discharge guard**: suspends forced discharge ~10 min before window end when paced power would drop below house load
- **Discharge SoC unavailability abort**: discharge sessions now abort after 3 consecutive SoC-unavailable checks, matching charge path behaviour
- **Safe state on failure**: listener callbacks catch unexpected exceptions, cancel the session, and revert to self-use
- **Unreachable charge target detection**: `charge_target_reachable` sensor attribute warns when even max power can't reach the target SoC in remaining time
- **Proactive error surfacing**: session errors surfaced via sensor attributes (`has_error`, `last_error`, `last_error_at`, `error_count`) instead of log-only
- **Reconfigure flow**: add or update web portal credentials without re-creating the config entry. Accepts both raw password and pre-computed MD5 hash.
- **Feed-in energy integration from WebSocket**: trapezoidal integration between REST polls for more accurate cumulative energy tracking
- **Feed-in early-stop**: schedules a one-shot stop based on observed export rate to prevent overshooting the feed-in energy limit

### Changed
- **Session orchestration via adapter pattern**: `__init__.py` reduced from 3056 to ~2030 lines (-34%). FoxESS-specific schedule merging encapsulated in `FoxESSCloudAdapter` and `FoxESSEntityAdapter`, delegating to brand-agnostic `smart_battery/listeners.py`.
- **WebSocket per-field unit handling**: respects the `unit` property on each power field (some sent as kW, others as W within the same message) instead of assuming uniform units
- **REST fallback on poll failure**: coordinator keeps last-known data when REST fails, preventing all entities flashing unavailable

### Fixed
- **Taper-path consumption bypass**: deferred start taper paths now account for household consumption, matching the linear path
- **WebSocket stale data filter**: messages with `timeDiff > 30` seconds are discarded
- **WebSocket grid direction**: power-balance-derived direction replaces unreliable `gridStatus` field
- **Taper profile corruption**: minimum actual power guard (50W) and plausibility check auto-reset corrupted profiles
- **Progress bars during inactive phases**: hidden during charge "deferred" and discharge "scheduled" phases
- **House load greyed out at low values**: overview card always shows actual value at full opacity
- **Reconfigure password whitespace**: `ensure_password_hash` strips trailing newlines from pasted hashes
- **Session recovery `start_soc`**: persisted for accurate progress bars after HA restart

## 1.0.0

### Added
- **Adaptive BMS taper model**: learns actual charge/discharge acceptance at each SoC level via exponential moving average, improving time estimates and power pacing at high/low SoC where BMS limits throughput
- **Full i18n support** (10 languages): English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese — covering entity names, service descriptions, config UI, Lovelace card labels, durations, and status text
- **Overview Lovelace card** (`custom:foxess-overview-card`): live 2×2 energy flow display with solar, battery, grid, and house nodes, auto-discovered via WebSocket entity map
- **EXAMPLES.md**: quick-start guide with copy-pasteable automations and dashboard setup
- Forecast chart: actual SoC history overlay, locked to configured interval, dashed line for past data
- Discharge progress bar shows energy schedule disparity when feed-in limit is set
- Entity names use HA `translation_key` for native localisation instead of hardcoded English strings
- CI: release gate on lint/test/hassfest/hacs, pre-push hook blocks tags without passing CI

### Changed
- Smart charge/discharge service descriptions now accurately describe rate pacing and deferred start behaviour
- Extracted shared `smart_battery/` library (algorithms, sensors, listeners) for multi-brand reuse
- GoodWe Battery Control moved to its own repository ([goodwe-control](https://github.com/nicois/goodwe-control))
- Refactored Lovelace card progress bar rendering

### Fixed
- SoC progress bar showing `?%` when `start_soc` is unavailable (sessions started before the field existed)
- Dark theme: progress bar tracks and time fills now use HA CSS variables instead of hardcoded rgba
- mypy compatibility between CI and pre-commit environments
