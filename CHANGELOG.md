# Changelog

## 1.0.0-beta.14

### Added
- **Adaptive BMS taper model**: learns actual charge/discharge acceptance at each SoC level via exponential moving average, improving time estimates and power pacing at high/low SoC where BMS limits throughput
- **Full i18n support** (10 languages): English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese — covering entity names, service descriptions, config UI, Lovelace card labels, durations, and status text
- **Overview Lovelace card** (`custom:foxess-overview-card`): live 2×2 energy flow display with solar, battery, grid, and house nodes, auto-discovered via WebSocket entity map
- **EXAMPLES.md**: quick-start guide with copy-pasteable automations and dashboard setup
- Forecast chart: actual SoC history overlay, locked to configured interval, dashed line for past data
- Discharge progress bar shows energy schedule disparity when feed-in limit is set
- Entity names use HA `translation_key` for native localisation instead of hardcoded English strings
- CI: release gate on lint/test/hassfest/hacs, pre-push hook blocks tags without passing CI

### Changed
- Smart charge/discharge service descriptions now accurately describe rate pacing and deferred start behaviour
- Extracted shared `smart_battery/` library (algorithms, sensors, listeners) for multi-brand reuse
- GoodWe Battery Control moved to its own repository ([goodwe-control](https://github.com/nicois/goodwe-control))
- Refactored Lovelace card progress bar rendering

### Fixed
- SoC progress bar showing `?%` when `start_soc` is unavailable (sessions started before the field existed)
- Dark theme: progress bar tracks and time fills now use HA CSS variables instead of hardcoded rgba
- mypy compatibility between CI and pre-commit environments
